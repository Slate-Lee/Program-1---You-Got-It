### Project Description:
This project holds information for movies (title,
director, release date, IMDB rating, and reviews) in  
the data class "Movie" and the storage class "MovieLibrary."
The user can access various options from the menu
which appears when the file is ran. The first option,
"import," asks the user for a file name, and imports
data from a text file into the library. After this,
the user may choose either the add another movie to
the library with the "add" function, print the
current library with the "display" function, and
finally export the current library to new text file
or overwrite a previous one with the "save" function.
