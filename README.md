Project Description:
    This project holds information for movies (title,
    director, release date, IMDB rating) in the data
    class "Movie" and the storage class "MovieLibrary."
    
    The user can access various options from the menu
    which appears when the file is ran. The first option,
    "import," asks the user for a file name, and imports
    data from a text file into the library. After this,
    the user may choose either the add another movie to
    the library with the "add" function, print the
    current library with the "display" function, and
    finally export the current library to new text file
    or overwrite a previous one with the "save" function.
